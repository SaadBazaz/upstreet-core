import Wrapper from '../../../components/preview/wrapper';
import { Pre, CodeBlock } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/codeblock';
import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';
import pkgJson from 'usdk/package.json';

Dive deeper into how the Agents SDK works in our [Concepts](/docs/concepts/agents-sdk) guide.

## Install from NPM

You can install the `usdk` command-line tool by running the following command in your Terminal:

<Tabs items={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn"]}>
 
```bash tab="npm"
npm install -g usdk
```
 
```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm install -g usdk
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn add -g usdk
```
 
</Tabs>

This assumes you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) installed in your computer. 

### Verify your installation (optional)

You can run the following command to see your currently installed version:
```bash
usdk version
```

This should output your current version, for example:

<Wrapper>
<div className="bg-transparent prose-no-margin px-20">

<div className="bg-fd-background rounded-lg">
```bash title="Terminal"
$ usdk version
```
<CodeBlock className='-mt-8' icon={"bash"} keepBackground allowCopy={false}>
        <Pre>{pkgJson.version}</Pre>
</CodeBlock>
</div>

</div>
</Wrapper>


<Callout>While you can also run `usdk` directly using `npx usdk@latest <subcommand>`, we recommend tying yourself to a specific version of the SDK while building your agent.</Callout>

## Log into the SDK
You must be logged into the SDK to carry out certain actions. You can log in by running: 
```bash
usdk login
```

This will open a browser where you can either log into your existing Upstreet account or create a new one.
