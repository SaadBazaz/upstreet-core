import Wrapper from '../../../components/preview/wrapper';

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';
import pkgJson from 'usdk/package.json';

To get started with Upstreet and building AI Agents, you need to set up the Upstreet Agents SDK (`usdk`). Dive deeper into how the Agents SDK works in our [Concepts](/concepts/agents-sdk) guide.


## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current) (version 22.1.0 and above)

## Install from NPM

You can install the `usdk` command-line tool by running the following command in your Terminal:

<Tabs items={["npm",]}>
 
```bash tab="npm"
npm install -g usdk
```

</Tabs>

{/* This assumes you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) installed in your computer.  */}

### Verify your installation (optional)

You can run the following command to see your currently installed version:

<Wrapper>
<div className="bg-transparent prose-no-margin px-20 w-full">

<div className="bg-fd-background rounded-lg">
```bash title="Terminal"
$ usdk version
```
<CodeBlock className='-mt-8' icon={"bash"} keepBackground allowCopy={false}>
        <Pre>{pkgJson.version}</Pre>
</CodeBlock>
</div>

</div>
</Wrapper>

You can see all versions of `usdk` on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/usdk?activeTab=versions).

<Callout>While you can also run `usdk` directly using `npx usdk@latest <subcommand>`, we recommend tying yourself to a specific version of the SDK while building your agent.</Callout>

## Log into the SDK
You must be logged into the SDK to carry out certain actions. You can log in by running: 
```bash
usdk login
```

This will open a browser where you can **Log In** to Upstreet using your preferred Authentication Provider.
