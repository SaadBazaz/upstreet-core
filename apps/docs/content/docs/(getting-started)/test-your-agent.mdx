To run and test your Agent, run:
```bash
usdk chat [agent-dir]
```
This will launch an interactive REPL-like chat in your terminal.

Prompt the Agent to perform the specific action you want to test, or use your own testing process to verify its functionality. Additionally, you can write tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to automate and ensure the reliability of your Agent's features.
