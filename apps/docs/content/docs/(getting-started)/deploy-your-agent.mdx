## Deploy to Upstreet

Ready to unleash your Agent into the world? Simply run:

```bash
usdk deploy <your-agent-directory>
```

Your Agent will be live and accessible via the provided URL obtained after a successful deployment.

This will consume credits. To learn more about pricing, head over to our [pricing section](/pricing).

## Self-hosting

You can also run your Agent locally and use Cloudflare tunnels to make it accessible to the Internet. This, however, may still consume AI credits if you choose to use our AI services.

See pricing models for self-hosting on our [Pricing](/pricing) page.
