The Agents SDK is built with [React](https://react.dev) using the [React Reconciler API](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-reconciler/README.md). This design allows Agents to run on servers and positions us for future multi-platform and edge deployments, including browsers.

Learn more about the React Reconciler in the [React documentation on Reconciliation](https://react.dev/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state).

## What are Upstreet Agents?

To learn more about basic concepts of Agents, read our general [Agents Concepts Guide](/concepts/what-are-agents).

In Upstreet, Agents are intelligent entities implemented as a React renderer, allowing them to perceive events and perform actions. React components allow for easy composition, customization, and sharing of every part of the stack, while retaining the full flexibility of Typescript to dig down to a lower level.

Dive deep into how an Upstreet Agent is structured [here](/concepts/agents-sdk/agent-structure).
