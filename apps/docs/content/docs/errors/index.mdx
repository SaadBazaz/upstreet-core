## Could not run the speaker module

This may occur when running `usdk chat` locally. The CLI uses audio output backends based on your operating system, in order to play audio in the CLI. To resolve this, you may need to install **optional dependencies** in your Agent, which involve the `speaker` module.

```bash
npm install --only=optional
```

You may need to install build tools on your system in order for this to work, as of yet.

1. macOS: XCode command line tools
2. Windows: Visual Studio build tools
