X integration allows your agent to interact with Twitter by responding to mentions.

## Step 1: Create a Twitter Developer Account
   - Go to https://developer.twitter.com/
   - Sign up for a developer account if you haven't already
   - Create a new project and app
   - Make sure your "User authentication settings" are set to "Native app" (Public client)
   - Copy your OAuth 2.0 application credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)

## Step 2: Log in with OAuth
   - Log in with OAuth at https://twitter-auth.upstreet.ai/
   - Use the Client ID and Client Secret from step 1

## Step 3: Configure your agent
   - Add the following component to your agent:
   ```tsx
   import { Twitter } from 'react-agents';

   return (
     <Agent>
       {/* ... */}
       <Twitter
         token="YOUR_TWITTER_TOKEN" // OAuth 2.0 token
       />
       {/* ... */}
     </Agent>
   );
   ```

## Additional Notes
   - The bot will automatically listen for and respond to mentions of your Twitter account
   - The token should be kept secure and not committed to version control
     - You can use `.env.txt` and the useEnv() hook to load it at runtime
   - The bot polls for new mentions every 10 seconds
   - Twitter API rate limits apply - see Twitter's [developer documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits) for details
   - The bot requires a stable internet connection to maintain communication with Twitter
   - Note: if you haven't created the agent yet, please follow this [Create an Agent](/create-an-agent) first.
