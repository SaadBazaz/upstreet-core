The `Agent` component serves as a high-level wrapper component that provides the core infrastructure for AI agent functionality in a React application. It acts as a container that:

- Establishes the communication context for AI interactions
- Manages the state and lifecycle of AI agent operations
- Provides necessary context and configuration to child components
- Enables action handling and event processing for nested agent functionalities

## Import `Agent` component
```javascript
<Agent>
  {/* Child components that need access to agent capabilities */}
  <YourAgentLogic />
</Agent>
```
